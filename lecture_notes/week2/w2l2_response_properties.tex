\section{Goals}

\subsection{Homogeneous solution}
The homogeneous solution is the response when the input is zero. For a second-order system,
\[
\ddot{y} + 2\zeta\omega_n \dot{y} + \omega_n^2 y = 0,
\]
the homogeneous solution is determined by the characteristic equation
\[
s^2 + 2\zeta\omega_n s + \omega_n^2 = 0.
\]

\subsection{Particular solution}
The particular solution is any one solution that matches the forcing input. For example, a constant (step) input often yields a constant steady-state output, while a sinusoidal input yields a sinusoidal steady-state output at the same frequency, with an amplitude and phase determined by the transfer function.

\subsection{Impulse and step as standard test inputs}
Two canonical inputs are:
\[
u(t)=\delta(t) \quad \text{(impulse)}, \qquad u(t)=u(t) \quad \text{(unit step)}.
\]
The impulse response is the output to $\delta(t)$ with zero initial conditions. The step response is the output to a unit step with zero initial conditions. These are forced responses. In contrast, a free-decay pendulum release is a zero-input response driven by nonzero initial conditions.

\begin{popquiz}
A second-order system has transfer function $G(s)=\frac{k}{s^2+2\zeta\omega_n s+\omega_n^2}$. Write an expression for $Y(s)$ for (i) an impulse input and (ii) a unit-step input. Do not invert the transforms.
\popqsplit
For an impulse, $U(s)=1$, so
\[
Y(s)=G(s)=\frac{k}{s^2+2\zeta\omega_n s+\omega_n^2}.
\]
For a unit step, $U(s)=1/s$, so
\[
Y(s)=\frac{k}{s\left(s^2+2\zeta\omega_n s+\omega_n^2\right)}.
\]
\end{popquiz}

\section{Natural frequency, damping, and damped frequency}
Second-order dynamics are everywhere: suspensions, doors, elevators, robots, and even sensor filtering. The parameters $\omega_n$ and $\zeta$ are a compact way to describe what the system does.

\subsection{Natural frequency $\omega_n$}
\textbf{Interpretation.} Roughly, $\omega_n$ sets the time scale of oscillation. For lightly damped systems, the oscillations are close to frequency $\omega_n$.

\textbf{Example interpretation.} Two car suspensions can have the same damping ratio but different $\omega_n$. The one with larger $\omega_n$ responds faster and oscillates more rapidly.

\subsection{Damping and damping ratio $\zeta$}
\textbf{Interpretation.} Damping describes how quickly oscillations die out. The dimensionless damping ratio $\zeta$ classifies the response:
\[
0<\zeta<1 \ \text{underdamped (oscillatory)}, \qquad
\zeta=1 \ \text{critically damped}, \qquad
\]
\[
\zeta>1 \ \text{overdamped (non-oscillatory)}.
\]

\textbf{Example interpretation.} A door closer is designed to avoid oscillation. Its effective damping ratio is typically at or above $1$ so the door returns smoothly without bouncing.

\subsection{Damped frequency $\omega_d$ and its dependence on $\zeta$}
For the characteristic equation
\[
s^2 + 2\zeta\omega_n s + \omega_n^2 = 0,
\]
the roots are
\[
s = -\zeta\omega_n \pm \omega_n\sqrt{\zeta^2-1}.
\]
When $0<\zeta<1$, the roots are complex:
\[
s = -\zeta\omega_n \pm j\omega_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}.
\]
The oscillation frequency is the imaginary part:
\[
\omega_d = \omega_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}.
\]
As damping increases (larger $\zeta$), the oscillation frequency decreases.

\begin{popquiz}
A system has $\omega_n=10$ rad/s. Compute $\omega_d$ for (i) $\zeta=0.1$, (ii) $\zeta=0.6$, and (iii) $\zeta=1.2$. State which cases oscillate.
\popqsplit
For $0<\zeta<1$, $\omega_d=\omega_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}$.
(i) $\omega_d=10\sqrt{1-0.01}=10\sqrt{0.99}\approx 9.95$ rad/s, oscillatory.
(ii) $\omega_d=10\sqrt{1-0.36}=10\sqrt{0.64}=8$ rad/s, oscillatory.
(iii) $\zeta>1$ means no oscillation; the poles are real and the response is overdamped.
\end{popquiz}

\section{Poles as roots of the characteristic equation}
For a transfer function
\[
G(s)=\frac{N(s)}{D(s)},
\]
the poles are the roots of $D(s)$. Poles determine the natural response and the transient behavior. In the second-order case,
\[
D(s)=s^2+2\zeta\omega_n s+\omega_n^2,
\]
so the pole locations encode both the decay rate (real part) and oscillation frequency (imaginary part). This is why identifying $\zeta$ and $\omega_n$ from a free-decay experiment is still a meaningful modeling task: it identifies the dominant poles of the dynamics.
